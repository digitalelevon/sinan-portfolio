            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">What Changed in SEO?</h2>
            <p>
                The days of simple keyword stuffing and basic backlink building are long gone. Today, SEO requires a holistic approach that combines technical excellence, user experience, and high-quality content. Google's algorithms now prioritize sites that offer genuine value to users.

            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Google AI Ranking Updates</h2>
            <p>
                Google's integration of AI into its core ranking systems means that search intent is more important than ever. The AI algorithms are incredibly adept at understanding the context of user queries. To rank well, your content must directly and comprehensively answer the questions your target audience is asking.

            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Importance of Core Web Vitals</h2>
            <p>
                Speed and usability are no longer optional. Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. This includes loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. A slow website will actively hurt your rankings, no matter how good your content is.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Rise of E-E-A-T</h2>
            <p>
                Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) are the pillars of Google's quality rater guidelines. Demonstrating that your content is created by a credible source with firsthand experience is critical. This is why having a professional portfolio and clear author profiles is essential.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Content Quality Remains King</h2>
            <p>
                While AI can help generate ideas, purely AI-generated content without human insight often falls flat. High-quality, original content that provides unique perspectives and in-depth analysis will always outperform shallow articles. Focus on creating comprehensive guides and answering specific pain points.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Mastering Internal Linking</h2>
            <p>
                Internal links help Google understand the structure and hierarchy of your website. They distribute page authority and keep users engaged. Make sure to logically link relevant pages. For example, if you mention your <Link href="/#services" className="text-primary hover:text-[#FFC107] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-primary/30 transition-colors duration-300">web development services</Link>, link directly to that page to guide users smoothly through your site.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Why Backlinks Still Matter</h2>
            <p>
                Despite all the new updates, high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites remain a strong signal of trust to Google. However, the focus is entirely on quality over quantity. Earning links naturally through exceptional content and digital PR is the only sustainable strategy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                SEO in 2026 is challenging but highly rewarding for those who follow the rules. By focusing on user experience, high-quality content, and technical excellence, you can achieve sustainable top rankings.
